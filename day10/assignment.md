# Enhance SQLite / Realm Task List App

You are provided with a basic task list application that allows users to add and delete tasks in live session.

## Enhancements:

### 1. Edit Tasks:

  - Users should be able to modify the content of existing tasks.
  - Consider implementing:
    - Double-tapping a task opens an edit window for text input and save button.
    - Upon confirmation (e.g., "Save" button), the updated task replaces the original one in the list.
      
## 2. Mark Tasks as Completed:

  - Users should be able to indicate task completion.
    - Implement a checkbox towards the left of task.
    - Selecting the checkbox marks the task as completed through strikethrough text or with a different color.
    - Completed tasks can be visually differentiated from incomplete ones (e.g., grayed out, moved to a separate "Completed" list).
