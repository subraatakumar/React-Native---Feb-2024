# Assignment: LinkedIn-Style Bottom Sheet

## Objective:

This assignment challenges you to create a resizable and collapsible bottom sheet component in React Native, similar to the one used in the LinkedIn post creation flow. The bottom sheet should be draggable for a smooth user experience.

## Requirements:

- Use react-native-gesture-handler to enable gesture-based interaction (dragging).
- Employ react-native-reanimated to create animations for opening and collapsing the bottom sheet.
- Implement smooth snapping behavior to two positions: fully open or partially closed.
- Design the bottom sheet with visual styles resembling the provided [video reference](https://youtube.com/shorts/Rptmx_ix6TI?feature=share).

## Bonus:

- Consider adding a handle or indicator for easier dragging.

## Learning Outcomes:

- Understanding of gesture handling with react-native-gesture-handler.
- Mastery of animations with react-native-reanimated.
- Creating reusable and interactive UI components.

## Resources:

- React Native Gesture Handler: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-gesture-handler
- React Native Reanimated: https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/1.x/nodes/call/

## Deliverables:

- A functional React Native component representing the draggable bottom sheet.
- A brief explanation of your code, highlighting key libraries and implementation details.
