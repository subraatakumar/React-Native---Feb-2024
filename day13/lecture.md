# Exploring React Native Maps and Location Services

## Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will be exploring the integration of maps and location services in React Native. You will develop a mobile application that fetches the route from the user's current location to a specified destination using the Expo Location API and displays it on a map using React Native Maps.

## Assignment Objectives:

- Gain practical experience in using React Native Maps to display maps and markers.
- Understand how to integrate location services in a React Native application using the Expo Location API.
- Learn how to fetch and display routes between two locations on a map.
- Enhance your skills in working with asynchronous operations and state management in React Native.

## Assignment Tasks:

- Project Setup: Set up a new React Native project using Expo CLI.
- Map Integration: Integrate the React Native Maps library into your project and display a map centered around your current location.
- Location Fetching: Implement functionality to fetch the user's current location using the Expo Location API and display it on the map as a marker.
- Destination Marker: Add a marker on the map representing a specified destination (e.g., Mumbai).
- Route Fetching: Fetch the route from the user's current location to the destination using a routing API (e.g., OpenStreetMap) and display it as a polyline on the map.
- Real-time Location Updates: Implement functionality to update the user's location periodically and update the displayed route accordingly.
- Styling and User Experience: Apply appropriate styling to the map and markers for better user experience. Ensure that the UI is responsive and intuitive.
- Testing and Debugging: Test your application on both iOS and Android devices/emulators. Debug any issues that arise during testing.
- Documentation: Provide clear documentation explaining the functionality of your application, including how to run it locally, any dependencies used, and any additional features implemented.

## Deliverables:

- A complete React Native project folder containing all the necessary files and dependencies.
- A detailed README.md file explaining the project setup, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any other relevant information.
- Submission of the project code via specified version control system (e.g., GitHub repository).

## Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Implementation of all required features (map display, location fetching, route fetching, real-time updates).
- Quality of code structure, readability, and adherence to best practices.
- User interface design, responsiveness, and overall user experience.
- Documentation clarity and completeness.

## Additional Notes:

You are encouraged to explore additional features and enhancements beyond the specified requirements to further enhance your learning experience.
- Seek help from online documentation, tutorials, and forums if you encounter any difficulties during the development process.
